# LSD-SLAM: Large-Scale Direct Monocular SLAM

LSD-SLAM is a novel approach to real-time monocular SLAM. It is fully direct (i.e. does not use keypoints / features) and creates large-scale, 
semi-dense maps in real-time on a laptop. For more information see
[http://vision.in.tum.de/lsdslam](http://vision.in.tum.de/lsdslam)
where you can also find the corresponding publications and Youtube videos, as well as some 
example-input datasets, and the generated output as rosbag or .ply point cloud.

This fork contains a version that relieves the user of the horrors of a ROS dependency and uses the much nicer lightweight [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) framework instead.

# Fork

This fork is a personal attempt at using LSD-SLAM on Windows through Visual Studio.
